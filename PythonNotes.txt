########## Data Type ############ 

x = 10 ==> Value represent the data type

Dynamic Type Language 


1.int 
long ==> not in Python 3 
2.float
complex
bool
str
bytes
bytesarray
range
list
tuple 
set
frozenset
dict
None

in python every thing is object
object 
Where the object is Store to check id(x).



int ==> to hold integral value  whole numbers ==> 
decimal form 
octal 
binary 
Hexa form 


to display number as binary 
x = 0b10

to display number as octal 
x = 0o10

to display number as hexa
x = 0x10


To Convert these value Python having Functions 
bin(x) ==> to convert the value in to Binary its can contains any type of value
hex(x) ==> to convert the value in to hexa decimal value 
oct(x) ==> to convert the value into octa decimal value 


float 
-------------
x = 134.45
x = 1.2e3 =====> 1.2*1000 ===> 1.2 * 10 rest 3 


complex type
-----------------
a + bj

a ==> Real Part
b ==> Imaginary Part 
j ==> Squre root of -1 ==> j^2 = -1 

In that real part you can take any type decimal,octa, Hexa any type but at imeginary part you can only desimal anf compulsary j required.
a = 10+20j
a.real ==> 10.0
a.imag ==> 20.0




bool 
-------
True and False 
other then these value python will not accept the bool value.
True ==> 1
Falase ==> 0


str 
----
String data type 
any sequence of charater 
'Bhavik' ==> recomended 
""" ==> for Mullti line 
"Bhavik" ==> Valid 
 
slice operator 
[begin:end]
return substring from begin index to end-1 index 

s = "Bhavik"
s[1:4] => hav

if you not pecifing end value then it will end with last index.
s = "Bhavik"
s[1:]
havik

if you not specifiing begin value then it will start from begin 
s = "Bhavik"
s[:4]
Bhav


[begin:end:step]

s= "bhavikmakwana"
s[1:6]
havik
s[1:6:2]
hvk


s='Bhavik'
s*3 
BhavikBhavikBhavik

String repetation 


Mutable and Immuutable 
--------------------------
1. Every thing in python is an object 
2. All the fundamental data type : 	int,f,b,c,s immutable

Reusable code is up to 256 int 
-----------------------------
x = 257
y = 257 
x is y
false 

Float and complex type are immutable.


Bytes 
---------------
it represent a group of Byte number just like an array 
and range is 0 to 256 
Bytes is immutable object. for that you need to go for bytearray 


list 
============
1. duplicates are allowed 
2. Inserion order is preserved 
3. mutable

tuple 
========
1. immutable 
2. represnet by () in list []


range()
===========
range is immutable 
represnt sequence of data type 

set
==========
indexing and sclice is not application to set
{}
set is immutable and order is not maintaing 
insertion order is not important  
duplicates not allowed 
heterogeneous object is allowed 
index is not allowed 
slicing is not allowed 
growable in nature 


frozenset is immutable 
-------------------------
same as set


dictory
============
Map wih key and value 

s = {100 : 'bhavik',200 :'test',30 : 'test24'}



String Methods List
=========================
message = 'Hello World'
1. len(message) --> length of Message 
2. message[0] --> get charater of 0 index from message 
3. messgae[0:5] --> get range of message from 0 index to 5 index not including 5 index 
4. message.lower() --> convert to lowecase
5. message.upper() --> convert to uppercase 
6. message.count('Hello') --> get count of input text
7. message.find('World') --> give index of input where it is. if its not found it returns -1 
8. message.replace('World','Universe') --> replacing the word from World to Universe 
9. dir(message) -> get All the methods from  of message.
10.help(str) --> get all the document of String
